## Inspiration

In 2018, I attended the MoMA exhibition **Items: Is Fashion Modern?** I was not then, nor am I now, a fashionista.I was a motorcycle rider doing good-partner duty to the designer I was dating at the time. I didn't expect to find much of interest at the show, but then I saw Asher Levine and Smooth Technology's prototype biker jacket.

I was struck by the strange lines and the swirling colors, and intrigued by the blend of electronic technology and utilitarian clothing.  I was also dismayed at how impractical and delicate the jacket appeared to be, and by the fact that it didn't actually do the thing it was intended to do!

I promptly forgot about the jacket until a friend and I were joking about having a way to tell other drivers __exactly__ what we thought of them.  This led to speculating about wearable LED grids and voice-to-text software.  I had recently written grid-to-serial display ssoftware for the WS2811 RGB LED addressing protocol and idly Googled "wearable LED DIY."

Long story short, I decided to use this Projects class as an opportunity to make a functional, practical version of the MoMA prototype.  Something much humbler, but that would actually turn my riding gear in to my signalling gear.
